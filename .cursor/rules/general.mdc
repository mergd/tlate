The proper command for doing type checking is pnpm run lint
Don't include useless/obvious comments when editing files.


Use kebab case for file names as well for consistency.


This is a shadcn UI, and this repo uses pnpm, NextJS 15.3.3, convex for auth and backend, React 19, Tailwind for styling.


Casting an object to any and then using the value should not be done just to fix a lint error in 99% in cases.
