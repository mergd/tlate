!! Use shadcn color tokens where possible, and then if needed use tailwind colors. No need for dark mode for now.

Don't use namespace import usage with React in particular, use the destructured import.

Try not to add Loading... - and use a real skeleton for loading states.

Use cards to keep visual displays consistent - more broadly using a lot of tailwind to style something is an antipattern.
This is because makes the code less readable – so try to not add too many classes, or add it directly to the component if necessary.


Do not use raw fetch – use tanstack query, and if it's commonly used, put it in the use folder

Make small/mobile display friendly – and a big tighter on spacing/compactness


Make sure to properly escape punctuation (i.e. ' to &apos; where needed)


## Misc

### Tables

Rows should generally be clickable, especially if there is information tucked into a responsive sheet

### Forms

Use react-hook-form, form components from the ui/form isntead of using say raw labels and inputs. 


## shadcn
If you need to add new components, use `npx shadcn@latest add $component_name`


If it's a component that is specific to a page and isn't general, include it in the same folder as opposed to adding it to the components folder and cluttering it up – a good example is a skeleton component
